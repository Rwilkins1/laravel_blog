                    <p>My purpose in creating this blog is to consolidate my work into one place and give the world a sample of the types of web experiences I can create with just a laptop and a week's time.</p>
                    <p>The resume tab in the navbar will take you to a detailed description of my educational and volunteering history. There, you will also learn which programming languages I am proficient in.</p>
                    <p>The portfolio tab in the navbar will take you to a list of major projects that I've completed both as a solo developer and in a group setting. Each project will have a link to it, if one is available, so you will be able to use the various applications that I have built for yourself.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the contact tab in the navbar will take you to an email form with which you can contact me. Whether you are looking to hire a dedicated full-stack web developer and think I fit the bill or whether you are just a fellow coder with questions or comments about my work, feel free to get in touch!</p>
