## Laravel PHP Framework

This is a blog that I wrote using PHP, JS, Jquery and CSS on the Laravel Framework.

## Getting Started
-Clone this repository
-Create a database for this application
-Create a '.env.local.php' file inside of 'blog.dev/'
-Add the contents of "env-template.php' to '.env.local.php'
-Add your database logins to the values
-Run 'composer install'
